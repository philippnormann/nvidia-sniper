This bot helps us buy Nvidia Founders Edition GPUs as soon as they become available.

Note: **This project is no longer being actively maintained.** Nvidia stopped selling Founders Edition cards through their own store and transitioned to exclusively selling via 3rd-party retailers. To buy from those 3rd-party retailers, you can check out other projects like [streetmerchant](https://github.com/jef/streetmerchant) or [fairgame](https://github.com/Hari-Nagarajan/fairgame).


## Features

- Continuously monitor the availability of target GPU on www.nvidia.com
- Automatically checkout item using PayPal or as guest (credit card)
- Automatically submit the order for credit card payment
- Support for multiple locales (as defined in `config/customer.json`)
- Support for multiple GPUs (as defined in `data/gpus.json`)

### CAPTCHA

This bot is equipped with the ability to resolve simple reCAPTCHA on its own without the use of a third party reCAPTCHA solver.  As long as you follow the recommendation in the usage section below, it is extremely likely that the bot will succesfully complete the full auto-checkout process.  With that said, there is a very small possibility that you will be presented with a more advanced reCAPTCHA requiring solving image tasks that the bot cannot handle natively.  If you would like to have a backup in place for that possibility, you have that option by following the steps below.   

1. Download the [ReCaptcha Solver](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/recaptcha-solver) extension using the link https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3423472/recaptcha_solver-5.7-fx.xpi. If you open this link in Firefox, it will automatically attempt to add the extension to your browser. That's not what we want. Right click the link and select "Save link as" to download the *.xpi file or try opening the link in a browser other than Firefox.
2. Put the *.xpi file inside the root of the `nvidia-sniper` directory.

3. Create an account using one of ReCaptcha Solver's supported APIs, ex. [2captcha](http://2captcha.com/?from=10326385). Deposit money into your account. A few :dollar: should be enough.
4. Start the bot as per the instructions in the [Usage](#Usage) section. After you go through the bot's selection process, you should see the ReCaptcha Solver extension in the browser.
5. Copy your API key from the provider of your choice. Add this key to the extension. Also, enable the checkboxes as shown below.

## Updating
To update `nvidia-sniper` use, `git pull` or download a fresh `.zip` archive from GitHub.

Make sure to back up the `customer.json` in advance as it might get replaced in the process.
## Usage

To use the bot, fill out `config/customer.json` and run the script.

```bash
cd nvidia-sniper
pipenv run python -m sniper
```

It is highly recommended that you use Firefox as your default browser and use it to log into Google services such as YouTube or Gmail. This dramatically reduces the possibility of reCAPTCHA requiring you to pass an image challenge during the bot's operation, thus enabling a fully automatic checkout without the need for manual intervention.
## Configuration
In the `config` folder a `customer.json` file and `notifications.json` file are used to configure the data used to auto fill the forms and to configure the bots notifications. To get started, copy and rename the two template files and customize the fields to your liking.

### `notifications.json`
The bot can send multiple push notifications, including a screenshot attachment along the checkout process. See https://github.com/caronc/apprise#supported-notifications for more information. Add additional entries to the `services` dictionary in the `notifications.json` file for multiple providers. For each notification, a custom `message` can be set. Additionally, the `screenshot` attachment can be toggled per provider.

A couple of example URLs for different notification services:
- `pover://user@token`: Pushover
- `tgram://bottoken/ChatID`: Telegram
- `discord://webhook_id/webhook_token`: Discord

### `customer.json`
In the `customer.json` file you can configure your locale and the field contents used for auto-filling the checkout forms. Some fields require specific values.

### `locale`
The `locale` field can have the following values:
- `de-at`: Austria

### `backup-speed`
There has been a common issue related to shipping speeds not being available when cards are available.
- `true`: (Default) Fallback to using the standard shipping speed when the desired speed isn't available
- `false`: Stop the bot from continuing with checkout

### `force`
Toggling this option forces sniper to use the address(es) in customer.json instead of the one suggested by Digital River during the checkout process.

- `false`: (Default) Use address(es) suggested by Digital River
